#           2.) Add a new column stating whether or not the term was found

"""	compare terms/phrases in Column P [index=15] of a spreadsheet to those in the DICE Dictionary for duplicates.

CrosscheckDictionary compares terms/phrases in question in Column Q [index = 16] of the YYMMDD_HHMM_ling-excerpts-CLIENT-processed_B.tsv spreadsheet (as *.txt) to terms/phrases present in the DICE Dictionary found in the SQL databased in workstation W0157340. 

This class uses the Spreadsheet class to load and initialize the spreadsheet file and the dictionary file for comparison. To compare, the column containing terms in both of these files' spreadsheets are extracted and compared. If there are term matches in the dictionary, "IN DICT" is inserted in a newly appended column of the Spreadsheet object. If there is no match, "NOT IN DICT" is inserted.
